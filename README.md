Introduction 📖
This project automates the testing of the SauceDemo website. SauceDemo is a web application that serves as a playground for automation engineers. Here, we utilize Selenium WebDriver with Java to demonstrate:

Page Object Model (POM) design pattern.
ExtentReports for generating interactive test reports.
Basic Selenium WebDriver operations.
Features ✨
Page Object Model (POM): Structuring your code in an organized way to enhance readability and maintainability.
ExtentReports: Providing detailed and visually appealing reports.
Basic Selenium Operations: Understanding the fundamentals of Selenium WebDriver.
